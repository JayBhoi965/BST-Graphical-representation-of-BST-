# BST-Graphical-representation-of-BST-
This is the graphical representation of a BST that I created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I might make some changes or add new features like In-order Traversal, pre-order Traversal, post-order Traversal, search min-key, search max-key etc... if my college reduce to give assignmentsðŸ™‚, I'll update it as soon as possible. But it's UI looking good and its logic also works Good By far. 

Hope You'll Not regret after try this Project :)
